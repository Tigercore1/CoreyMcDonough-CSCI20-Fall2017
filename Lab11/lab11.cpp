'x' is the number of incorrect guesses
Set 'x'=0
The computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 10
The user inputs a number between 1-10
If the input matches the randomly generated number, display "10-'x'" points and restart at step 2.
If incorrect, the computer displays either "higher" or "lower"
Add one more onto 'x' (x+1)
Repeat back at step 4

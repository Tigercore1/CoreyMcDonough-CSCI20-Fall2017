"Students" class. This stores all the information for each of the students. (name, multiple choice answers, fill in the blank answers). 
The class has a get function and multiiple set function. One stores all the information in the class from the file, while the gets take the information into the main.

All the key data is taken from the text file and stored in the main.

Student class/object is reused for each student. All of this is inclosed in a while loop that ends when the file ends.
Student's name is fout'd.
A series of if/else statements compares the students' responses to the key. 
Each if/else also adds and subtracts points onto their total grade. 
if (response == ?){
fout << question number;
}
else if (response == keyanswer){
score += 1;
}
else {
fout << question number;
score -= .25;
}
Student's grade is fout'd.
